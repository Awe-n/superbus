          FUTURE HOME SERVER PROJECT - IDEAS & PLANS
================================================================================

OVERVIEW:
---------
Personal home server setup using a Mac Mini (M1/M2) to create a comprehensive
home automation and media management system. This will serve as a central hub
for all personal data, backups, and services - eliminating reliance on cloud
services and providing complete control over personal data.

HARDWARE SETUP:
--------------
- Mac Mini (M1 or M2, 256GB internal storage is sufficient)
- External storage: 4TB+ USB-C/Thunderbolt drive
  * Consider RAID enclosure for data redundancy (2-bay with mirroring)
  * All media and files stored on external drive
  * Internal Mac Mini storage only for OS and applications

================================================================================
PROJECTS TO IMPLEMENT:
================================================================================

1. NAS + MEDIA SERVER STACK
   ------------------------
   Purpose: Automated movie and TV show management with Netflix-like interface
   
   Components:
   - Plex or Jellyfin (media streaming server)
   - Sonarr (TV show automation)
   - Radarr (movie automation)
   - Prowlarr (indexer management)
   - qBittorrent (download client)
   - Overseerr (request interface - search and request content easily)
   
   What it does:
   - Request movies/shows through beautiful web interface
   - Automatically downloads, organizes, and adds to library
   - Watch on any device (phone, tablet, laptop, TV)
   - Works remotely with Tailscale
   
   Storage needs: 2-4TB minimum, grows over time


2. FILE SERVER (NextCloud)
   ------------------------
   Purpose: Personal cloud storage - like Dropbox/Google Drive but self-hosted
   
   Features:
   - Sync files across all devices automatically
   - Share files with friends/family
   - Calendar and contacts sync
   - Photo auto-upload from phone
   - Collaborative document editing
   - No subscription fees
   - Complete control over data
   
   Why: Replace paid cloud services, keep data private


3. TIME MACHINE SERVER
   ---------------------
   Purpose: Centralized backup system for all Apple devices
   
   What it backs up:
   - All Mac computers in the home (automatic wireless backups)
   - Version history (go back in time to recover old files)
   - Complete system snapshots
   
   For iPhones/iPads backup:
   - Note: Time Machine doesn't directly back up iOS devices
   - iOS devices can backup to Mac Mini via iTunes/Finder connection
   - Or use NextCloud for photo/file backup from iOS
   - Consider additional solution for automated iOS backups
   
   Why: Automated, set-and-forget backups without iCloud subscription


4. TAILSCALE EXIT NODE (VPN)
   ---------------------------
   Purpose: Secure remote access and route internet through home connection
   
   Use cases:
   - Access home network from anywhere in the world
   - Watch home Netflix library while traveling abroad
   - Secure internet on public Wi-Fi (coffee shops, airports)
   - Access all home services remotely (NAS, media server, etc.)
   - Bypass geo-restrictions using home IP address
   - Bank from abroad without "suspicious location" blocks
   
   How it works:
   - Creates encrypted private network between devices
   - All internet traffic routes through home Mac Mini
   - Websites see your home IP, not your actual location
   
   Why: Security + convenience + access home services anywhere


5. UPTIME KUMA
   ------------
   Purpose: Monitor all services and get alerts if something goes down
   
   Features:
   - Beautiful dashboard showing status of all services
   - Get notifications on phone if something stops working
   - Check if websites are up
   - Monitor response times
   - Status page to share with others
   
   Why: Know immediately if something breaks, peace of mind


6. RSS READER (FreshRSS)
   ----------------------
   Purpose: News and blog aggregator - follow content without algorithms
   
   Features:
   - Subscribe to blogs, news sites, podcasts
   - Read on any device (synced reading progress)
   - No algorithm deciding what you see
   - Save articles for later
   - Organize with folders and tags
   
   Why: Take control of content consumption, avoid social media algorithms


7. MINECRAFT SERVER
   ------------------
   Purpose: Host private Minecraft server for friends
   
   Features:
   - Play with friends anytime
   - Custom world that's always online
   - Install mods and plugins
   - No need to pay for server hosting
   - Complete control over server settings
   
   Why: Fun project, learn server management, play with friends

================================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
================================================================================

PHASE 1 - Foundation:
- Set up Mac Mini with external storage
- Install Docker Desktop
- Set up Tailscale for remote access
- Configure Time Machine server (built into macOS)

PHASE 2 - Core Services:
- Deploy media server stack (Plex + automation tools)
- Set up NextCloud for file syncing
- Install Portainer for easy Docker management

PHASE 3 - Enhancement:
- Add Uptime Kuma for monitoring
- Set up RSS reader
- Deploy Minecraft server (optional, when friends want to play)

PHASE 4 - Optimization:
- Configure backups for the server itself
- Set up alerts and notifications
- Fine-tune performance
- Add additional services as needed

================================================================================
ESTIMATED COSTS:
================================================================================

If buying new:
- Mac Mini M1 (8GB): €600-700
- 4TB External USB-C Drive: €80-100
- (Optional) RAID Enclosure + 2x 4TB drives: €450
TOTAL: €680-800 basic, €1150+ with RAID

If already have Mac Mini:
- 4TB External Drive: €80-100
TOTAL: Less than €100!

Ongoing costs: Basically $0 (just electricity, ~€5-10/month)

================================================================================
BENEFITS OF THIS SETUP:
================================================================================

✓ Complete data ownership - no cloud companies have your files
✓ No monthly subscriptions (save €10-30/month on various services)
✓ Access everything from anywhere (with Tailscale)
✓ Learn valuable skills (Docker, networking, server management)
✓ One-time investment vs continuous cloud payments
✓ Expandable - add more services anytime
✓ Mac Mini is powerful enough for all this and more
✓ Low power consumption (~15W, runs 24/7)
✓ Silent operation
✓ Professional-grade setup at home

================================================================================
LEARNING RESOURCES:
================================================================================

When ready to implement:
- Docker documentation: docs.docker.com
- Tailscale setup: tailscale.com/kb
- r/selfhosted on Reddit - amazing community
- r/homelab - for inspiration and help
- YouTube: TechnoTim, Awesome Open Source, NetworkChuck

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS:
================================================================================

1. Acquire hardware if needed (Mac Mini + external storage)
2. Review Docker basics
3. Set up Tailscale first (easiest, immediate benefit)
4. Start with one service (media server or NextCloud)
5. Add services gradually, one at a time
6. Join r/selfhosted community for support

Remember: Start small, add incrementally. Don't try to do everything at once!
Each service is independent, so can add/remove without affecting others.
